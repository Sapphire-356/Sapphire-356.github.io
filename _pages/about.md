**Research**: My research is primarily focused on VLMs, MLLMs, domain adaptation, open-world learning, and unsupervised learning in computer vision, with an emphasis on enhancing model generalization and robustness under domain shift and limited supervision. Specifically, I co-authored a CVPR 2023 paper introducing a source-free domain adaptation method that preserves inter-class relationships. At AAAI 2025, I presented a universal domain adaptation approach leveraging text representations for semantic clustering. I also presented a paper at ICCV 2025 that re-examined the limitations of existing UDA settings in the context of large-scale pre-trained models and proposed a broader adaptation paradigm.

**Background**: I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I also received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Automation. My research has led to publications in top-tier conferences such as CVPR, AAAI, and ICCV, under the supervision of Prof. Zilei Wang. 

**I am actively looking for research internships.**
